# NFL-Menu

I wanted a little menu on my mac to jump to different games. Here's a first crack at it.
Click on the poorly-rendered football and this week's games are listed. Pick one and it opens your default browser to the Gameday page.

## TODO

* Submenus of the different audio/video sources
* Highlight on hover
* Hide/Shrink finished games
* Background Audio if I can manage such a thing

## DONE?
* Current Scores
* Refreshing data
